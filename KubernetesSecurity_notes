RBAC,IRSC, ClusterRoles, ClusterRole binding
----------------------------------------------------

POD needs access to AWS resources -either to create ALB
or attach security group to your worker nodes(EC2)

/
IN place of POD , if it is an EC2 instance, how to have the same accesses?

Attach a role which has required policies.
/
Similarly, can attach a role to POD, but pod life is not simple.
So we need to deploy in deployment manifest

Deployment is a kubernetes construct
Need to abstract cloud specific construct in K8s construct
 - enables k8s to run in multiple platform
say hello to service account

ALB/EC2 policies-> attached to a role -> attached to a Service account -> attached to deployment manifest
