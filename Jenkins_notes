A jenkins pipeline is a collection of events/jobs interlinked with each other in a sequence

Methods to create a pipeline
------------------------------
1) Using Build pipeline plugin 
2) pipeline plugin -> entire pipeline as code

Why use Jenkins pipeline?
1)  Using Groovy OSL,it models easy to complex pipelines as code
2)  Code is stored in jenkinsfile that can be scanned into SCM
3)  Supports complex pipeline by adding conditional loops
4)  Improves user experience by integrating user feedback

Types of jenkins pipeline
---------------------------
Declarative pipeline - new concept 
  - simpler and flexible groovy syntax 
  - defined within pipeline block
  - easier to read and write
  - Declarative
Scripted pipeline 
    strict groovy based syntaxes 
  - defined within node block
  - Imperative
 
Example:
-------------
  pipeline
  {
   agent any 
   stages {
     stage(build) {
       steps{
       sh 'echo "hello"'
         }
       }
     }
  }
 Groovy Script
 ==================
 Install Java - atleast Java 7
 Install groovy
 
 .groovy is the extension
 class groovytut{
    static void main(string[] args){
      println("hello");
      }
   }
   
 To run ,
 groovy groovytut.groovy
