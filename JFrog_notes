What is an artifact?
   The files that contain both the compiled code and the resources that are used to compile them 
   are known as artifacts. They are readily deployable files.
   
   .jar, .war, .ear, .tar.gz(NPM) , .dll(.NET)

source code-> bulid tool -> compilation -> Binary + Dependencies/resources-> Artifact

An artifcact repository is one which stores multiple versions of artifacts.
It is stored in a dedicated server for artifacts.

If a deployment fails, instead of going to the previous commit and building again, its easier to get the previous version of artifact.

Versioned by content    Versioned by name
Stored by override      Not stored by override
