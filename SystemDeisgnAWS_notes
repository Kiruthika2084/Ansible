System design on AWS
---------------------

Monolith - Single tiered application in which user interface and data access code are combined into a single proglem
on a single platform

Pros:
Simple
No overengineering
single code base
Resource efficient at small 

Cons:
Modularity is hard to enforce as app grows
scaling is a challenge
All or nothing deployment
Slow to react to customer demand

Can you use API with Monolith ? Yes

Issue of scaling
--------------------
store-> get |
            |
store-> post| API Gateway/Load balancer --> Monolith(entry fn to check url/path and execute fn -> Database
            |
store-> del |


If traffic for store-get increases, threshold of CPU reach the limit
if monolith runs on EC2 and uses autoscaling, you would endup scaling the entire application

With microservices, each codebase for get/post/del would run in a different EC2 machine, in different instant types

can be written in different programming languages (this feature is called polyglot)
each service can scale independently

Independent
-scaling 
-governance
-deployment
-testing
-functionality

Microservices can run in EC2/Lambda(serverless)/EKS/ECS... can front it with ELB or API gateway
